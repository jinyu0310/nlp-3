# How does it work
We built a little DOM. A "Word" consists of multiple "Splittings". A "Splitting" has a "WordPart" in the role
prefix, stem and suffix

"Word" 1--* "Splitting" 1-Prefix-1 "WordPart"
                    	1-Stem-1 "WordPart"
                    	1-Suffix-1 "WordPart"

A "Text" contains prefixes, stems and suffixes which are unique within the text. (In one text instance,
there are no two suffixes with the same name)


## Text parsing

In a first step, the text is read using the *Text* class.

### Splittings

The splittings are generated by the word class. All possible splittings are generated
(using a double loop)

## Finite state Transducer

We decided to implement our own FST, since we require don't need many features and it seemed
more difficult to learn a new tool.

There is no single class capturing the concept of the FST. First, the states and the links are 
constructed. Then a configuration is initialized with the start state, the tapes and a result collector.

Then the configuration is beeing run. The configuration recursively creates copies of the itself
and lets the copies traverse the links. Whenever a configuration reaches an accepting state, the 
configuration is passed to the result collector.  
 
### Weights
Each link has a weight, and the weights are summed up in the configurations as they traverse the links.

### FstPrinter
The FstPrinter traverses a state graph and creates a textual representation of the graph, suitable
for the dot tool (which is part of GraphViz)

### ResultCollector
The result collector collects the results of running an FST. 

## Optimizations

### Weight adaption

#### Depending on length

#### Depending on number of splittings
